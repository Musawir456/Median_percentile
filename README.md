## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 1️⃣ Median
- Middle value of a sorted dataset  
- If number of values is odd → middle number  
- If even → average of two middle numbers  

### 2️⃣ Percentile
- Divides data into 100 equal parts  
- Example:
  - 25th Percentile (Q1)  
  - 50th Percentile (Median)  
  - 75th Percentile (Q3)
